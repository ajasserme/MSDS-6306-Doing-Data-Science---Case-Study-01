# Beer-EDA-and-Prediction

>We used two data sets involving United States craft breweries and craft beers. Our EDA spanned from examining the number of breweries in each state to the relationship between beer variables, such as ABV, ounces, and length of beer name. We then used KNN and Naive Bayes to classify a beer as either an IPA or Ale.

## Summary
Below are several of our findings via graphs:

We also identified tours offered by the top beer producers. We matched this with a heat map of craft breweries per state and proposed to open 2 additional Budweiser breweries to public tours.

Finally, we accurately predicted if a beer was an IPA or Ale 85.5% of the time using KNN. This slightly outperformed Naive Bayes' accuracy of 83.7%.
